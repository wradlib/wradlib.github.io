# Release 0.11.0

We are happy to announce the release of wradlib 0.11.0.

It introduces our first shot at reading IRIS (Sigmet) data - a feature that has been requested by quite a number users. Learn more about io.read_iris, and see it at work [here](http://docs.wradlib.org/en/latest/notebooks/fileio/wradlib_radar_formats.html#Vaisala-Sigmet-IRIS). We are looking forward to your feedback!

In addition, we redesigned the `io` and `georef` modules. As a user, you will hopefully not notice. As a developer, you will hopefully welcome a higher level of (sub-)modularization.

For more details on the new release, please visit our [release notes](http://docs.wradlib.org/en/latest/release_notes.html).
