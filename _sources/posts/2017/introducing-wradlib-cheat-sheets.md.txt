# Introducing  {{wradlib}}  Cheat-Sheets

Today we are glad to announce the start of a series of **Cheat-Sheets** covering all aspects of wradlib. The first **Cheat-Sheet** is _**Wradlib Getting Started**_ which is available via the new [Downloads-Section](../../pages/downloads).

**Cheat-Sheets** are very well established not only within the Python-Community. Who of us has not used the [GitHub Git Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) or the [CONDA Cheat Sheet](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) to get **git** and **conda** running?

Often it is vital to have the most needed commands and code snippets at hand. We think the  {{wradlib}}  **Cheat-Sheets** will help first time users as well as advanced users to get important information on a single sheet of paper.

We are looking forward to hear your opinions especially about what the  {{wradlib}}  users consider most wanted as topic for the second **Cheat-Sheet**. Please get in touch with us via [email](mailto:wradlib@wradlib.org), the [oepnradar-discourse](https://openradar.discourse.group/tags/wradlib) or in [Gitter-Chat](https://gitter.im/wradlib/Lobby).
