#  {{wradlib}}  moves to github.com

After over a year of reflection and thoughts, we finally decided to move from [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/wradlib/wradlib) to [github](https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib).

This means also to switch the versioning system from *mercurial* to *git*. The repository was transferred to git via hg-git. Thus, the commit history is available right from the beginning. The [wradlib repo at bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/wradlib/wradlib) will be left available for reference.

The first step on github was setting up continuous integration, which works fine with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org). Within this process the  {{wradlib}}  docs are made available at [wradlib-docs](http://wradlib.github.io/wradlib-docs/). The whole process is not yet finished, so [stay tuned](https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib/issues/6).
