#  {{wradlib}}  goes toward python3

With [Pull Request #5](https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib/pull/5) we made the first step to have  {{wradlib}}  support Python3. All tests are running fine now, so we consider this a straight conversion. Nevertheless, there is an [open issue](https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib/issues/8) which gets hold of remaining conversion problems. If you find a bug or issue, please report it there.
