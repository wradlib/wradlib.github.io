# Welcome

The  {{wradlib}}  project has been initiated in order facilitate the use of weather radar data as well as to provide a common platform for research on new algorithms.  {{wradlib}}  is an open source library which is well documented and easy to use. It is written in the free programming language Python.

# Focus

Weather radar data is potentially useful in meteorology, hydrology and risk management. Its ability to provide information on precipitation with high spatio-temporal resolution over large areas makes it an invaluable tool for short term weather forecasting or flash flood forecasting.

# Ambition

wradlib is designed to assist you in the most important steps of processing weather radar data. These may include: reading common data formats, georeferencing, converting reflectivity to rainfall intensity, identifying and correcting typical error sources (such as clutter or attenuation) and visualising the data.
